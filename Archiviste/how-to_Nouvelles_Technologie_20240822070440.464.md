Please give me some more information! I need to know what you're interested in to give you relevant news about machine learning and new technology. 

For example, are you interested in:

* **Specific industries** where machine learning is being used (e.g., healthcare, finance, manufacturing)?
* **Types of machine learning** (e.g., deep learning, natural language processing)?
* **Ethical considerations** surrounding machine learning?
* **New breakthroughs** in machine learning research?
* **Applications of new technology** like AI, robotics, or blockchain?

Once you tell me what you're looking for, I can provide you with some helpful news articles and resources.
