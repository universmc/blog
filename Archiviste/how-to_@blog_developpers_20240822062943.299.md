Okay, I'm preparing your How-To guide for the  @blog_developpeurs Telegram channel. 

Please tell me: 

**What specific topic within web development do you want the guide to focus on?** 

For example:

*  How to set up a Node.js server
*  How to create a basic HTML website
*  How to use Git for version control
*  How to deploy a website on Netlify

The more specific you are, the better I can tailor the guide to your audience's needs. 


Let me know and I'll start crafting your guide!
