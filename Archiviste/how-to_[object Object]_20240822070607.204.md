It looks like you're seeing JavaScript's way of representing objects. 

Here's what's happening:

* **Objects in JavaScript:** Objects are complex data structures that store collections of key-value pairs.  

* **`[object Object]`:** This is how JavaScript's built-in `toString()` method represents an object when you try to display it directly. It's a shorthand way of saying "this is an object, but I don't have the details to show you its contents."

**To see the actual content of an object, you need to use methods like:**

* **`console.log(object)`:**  This will print the object's structure and values in your browser's console.
* **`for...in` loop:** This lets you iterate over the object's properties and access their values.
* **Dot notation (`.`) or bracket notation (`[]`)**: You can access specific properties of an object using their names.


Let me know if you have a specific object you'd like to explore, and I can help you understand its contents!
