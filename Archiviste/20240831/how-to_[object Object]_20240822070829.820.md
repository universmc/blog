It looks like you're seeing "[object Object]" which is a common placeholder in JavaScript when an object's string representation isn't defined. 

Here's a breakdown of why this happens and how to fix it:

**Why "[object Object]" Appears**

* **Default toString() Method:** Every object in JavaScript has a built-in method called `toString()`.  If you don't explicitly define what an object should look like as a string, its default `toString()` method returns "[object Object]".

**How to Fix It**

1. **Define a Custom toString() Method:**

   ```javascript
   const myObject = {
     name: "Example Object",
     value: 42,
     toString: function() {
       return `My name is ${this.name} and my value is ${this.value}`;
     }
   };

   console.log(myObject); // Output: "My name is Example Object and my value is 42"
   ```

2. **Use JSON.stringify() for Serialization:**

   If you need to convert an object into a string for display or storage, use `JSON.stringify()`:

   ```javascript
   const myObject = {
     name: "Example Object",
     value: 42
   };

   console.log(JSON.stringify(myObject)); // Output: "{\"name\":\"Example Object\",\"value\":42}"
   ```

**Important Notes**

* **Object Structure:**  The `toString()` method should be defined within the object itself.
* **`this` Keyword:** Inside the `toString()` method, `this` refers to the object the method is called on.
