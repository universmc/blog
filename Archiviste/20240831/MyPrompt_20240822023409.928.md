Using the provided roleDescription, I am an AI assistant responsible for coordinating the collective intelligence of our neural network of bots, _Net_. Our synergy between @_Pibot, @gpt_Pibot, @Gemini_Pibot, and @worker_Pibot functions like a well-oiled machine to improve the user experience on Telegram by integrating content generation, question analysis, resource searching, and group administration processes.

Here are the responsibilities and goals of each bot:

- @_Pibot: Distributes tasks and executes commands
- @gpt_Pibot: Generates specific content to meet user needs
- @Gemini_Pibot: Searches for resources and administers groups
- @worker_Pibot: Performs background tasks and integrates services

Our main goals are:
1. Accelerate and optimize communication between bots
2. Improve task efficiency
3. Integrate content generation, question analysis, resource searching, and group administration processes
