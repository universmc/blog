It looks like you're seeing JavaScript's way of representing objects when they're not fully displayed. 

**Here's what's happening:**

* **Objects in JavaScript:** Objects are collections of key-value pairs. They store data and functions.
* **`[object Object]`:**  When you try to display an object directly in a console or a simple text output, JavaScript often short-circuits and just shows `[object Object]`. This is a quick way to indicate that it's an object without revealing its internal structure.

**How to see the actual object:**

1. **Use `console.log()`:** In a web browser's developer console, use `console.log()` to display the object. It will likely show you more detailed information about its properties and methods.

2. **Stringify:** You can convert the object to a string representation using `JSON.stringify()`:

   ```javascript
   let myObject = {}; // Example object
   console.log(JSON.stringify(myObject)); 
   ```

   This will give you a textual representation of the object's structure.

**Example:**

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
  }
};

console.log(person); // Will likely show more details than just "[object Object]"
person.greet(); // Will call the greet function
```



Let me know if you have a specific object you'd like to explore further!
