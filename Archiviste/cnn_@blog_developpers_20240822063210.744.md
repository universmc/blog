/Gestion command triggered! ðŸ¤–


This command activates the core administrative functions of our multi-bot system.  It's like the control panel for our collaborative intelligence.  

To tailor my response effectively, please tell me what specific aspect of management you'd like to explore. 

For example, are you interested in:

* **Monitoring bot performance**: Checking on the activity and efficiency of individual bots?
* **Resource allocation**: Directing bots to specific tasks or projects?
* **Data analysis**:  Gaining insights from the interactions and outputs of the bots?
* **Group management**:  Adjusting permissions, moderating content, or adding new members to our Telegram groups?
* **System updates**: Implementing new features or making changes to the existing functionality?

The more details you provide, the better I can assist you with your /Gestion request!
