It looks like you're seeing JavaScript's representation of objects.  

**Here's what's happening:**

* **Objects in JavaScript:** Objects are fundamental data structures in JavaScript. They store collections of key-value pairs. 
* **`[object Object]`:** When you try to display an object directly in a console or log it, JavaScript often simplifies the output to `[object Object]`. This is a shorthand way to indicate that you're looking at an object without showing its internal structure.

**To see the actual contents of an object, you need to use methods like:**

* **`console.log(object)`:** This will usually display the object's structure in a more readable format.
* **`for...in` loop:** You can iterate through the object's properties using a `for...in` loop.

**Example:**

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  occupation: "Engineer"
};

console.log(person); // Output: { name: "Alice", age: 30, occupation: "Engineer" }

for (const key in person) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}
// Output:
// name: Alice
// age: 30
// occupation: Engineer
```



Let me know if you have any specific objects you'd like to explore further!
